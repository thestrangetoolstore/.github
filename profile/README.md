The Strange Tool Store is a co-operative who craft and curate strange tools.

What's strange about them? Well, we don't subscribe to the conventions of modern surveillance software and blackbox processes, software that doesn't respect you as the tool owner and tool user. Or as Cory Doctorow (2023) would have put it the "enðŸ’©tification" of software.

Strange tools put you back in charge of the bicycle for the mind (Jobs, 1990)
